                        <i>My-Arabic.com</i> aims at providing a full in-depth Arabic grammar and vocabulary course.
                        It is inspired by Br. Asif's lessons on YouTube, which are based on the three Madinah Books by
                        dr. V. Abdur Raheem.

                        This site ensues an effort in the hopes of summarizing the aforementioned works,
                        and effectively compile them into a single user-friendly and interactive web-course!
